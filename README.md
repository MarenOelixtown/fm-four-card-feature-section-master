## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

ðŸ‘‰ I created suitable grid layouts for different devices for having a responsive design.
ðŸ‘‰ This time i did not import the font from google fonts as a link but integrated it directly in the project as a local woff2-file and embedded it in the css with @font-face.

### Continued development

I would also like to keep an eye on accessibilty for future projects.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Layout Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me for getting a good overview of how grid behaves
